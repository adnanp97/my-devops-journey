Level 5: The Boss Battle - Combining Basics

Mission: Combine what you've learned! Write a script that:
1. Creates a directory names 'Battlefield'
2. Inside Battlefield, create files named knight.txt, sorcerer.txt, and rogue.txt.
3. Check if knight.txt exists; if it does, move it to a new directory called Archive.
4. List the contents of both Battlefield and Archive.

#create Battlefield
mkdir Battlefield

#creates files 
cd Battlefield
touch knight.txt sorcerer.txt rogue.txt
cd ..

#check knight
mkdir Archive

if [[ -f "/Battlfield/knight.txt" ]]; then
echo "file moved"
else
echo "does not exist"
fi

ls Battlefield Archive
