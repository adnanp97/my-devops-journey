Introduction to computer networks
- group of devices connected to each other allowing them to share info and resources

Local area network (LAN)
- samll covers small are
- Example home wifi

Widde area network WAN
- internet is an example

### Importance in modern infrastructure

Foundation - enables communication between devices

Resource sharing - Facilitates sharing of files printers and more

Internet functionality - critical for browsing, streaming and communication

Application support - backbone for app connectivity and data transfer


### Netorking in DevOps

Server interation - enables communication between servers and applications

Deployment - critical for launching and updating applicaitons

Management - cruical in monitioning and managing infrastructure

Opimisation - enhances troublue shooting, performance and scalability (data moving smooth and fast between devices)

## Network basics and types of networks - LAN & WAN etc

### Types of Networks

LAN
- small area e.g. home or office
- connects devices to share resource
- connects devices in a single locaiton e.g. printers, computers, internet access in a small area

WAN
- best example is internet which connects devices globally
- Large area e.g. citym country, larger region

## Switches, routers and firewalls

### Switches
- think of it as a manager of your LAN
- Connect devices within the same network e.g. cpu, printers
- Manage data flow within a LAN
- switches ensures data flows smoothly between these devices


### Routers
- like a traffic warden for a network e.g. router connets home network to internet. ensures data gets to the correct location, whether you are browsing, streaming etc.
- main role is to direct traffic between networks
- connect different networks e.g. home network to internet


### Firewalls
- acts as a bodyguard for your network
- Protect networks from unauthorised access
- monitors and controls incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predetermined security rules

## IP address (Internet protocol address) & MAC address

### IP Addressing 
- An IP address - unique for devises on a network
- Allows devices to locate and communicate

### IP Addressing (IPv4 & IPv6)
