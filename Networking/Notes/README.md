## Introduction to Computer Networks

- A **computer network** is a group of devices connected to each other, allowing them to share information and resources.

### Local Area Network (LAN)

- Covers a small area, like a home or office. Can communicate 
- **Example:** Home Wi-Fi.

### Wide Area Network (WAN)

- Covers a large area, such as a city or country.
- **Example:** The internet.

---

## Importance in Modern Infrastructure

- **Foundation**: Enables communication between devices.
- **Resource Sharing**: Facilitates sharing of files, printers, and more.
- **Internet Functionality**: Essential for browsing, streaming, and communication.
- **Application Support**: Backbone for app connectivity and data transfer.

---

## Networking in DevOps

- **Server Interaction**: Enables communication between servers and applications.
- **Deployment**: Crucial for launching and updating applications.
- **Management**: Vital in monitoring and managing infrastructure.
- **Optimization**: Enhances troubleshooting, performance, and scalability (ensures data moves smoothly between devices).

---

## Network Basics and Types of Networks - LAN & WAN

### Types of Networks

**LAN**  
- Covers a small area, like a home or office.
- Connects devices to share resources (e.g., printers, computers, internet access in small area).

**WAN**  
- Connects devices across large areas (city, country, or larger region).
- Connects multiple LANs
- **Example:** The internet, which connects devices globally.


---

## Switches, Routers, and Firewalls

### Switches
- Acts as a manager within a **LAN**.
- Connects devices within the same network (e.g., computers, printers).
- Ensures data flows smoothly between devices within the LAN.

### Routers
- Manages traffic between networks, such as a home network and the internet.
- Connects different networks e.g. home network to internet.
- Ensures data reaches the correct destination (e.g., while browsing or streaming).
  
### Firewalls
- Protects the network from unauthorized access.
- Monitors and controls incoming and outgoing network traffic based on security rules.
- Monitors network traffic to enhance security

---

## IP Address (Internet Protocol Address) & MAC Address

### IP Addressing
- An **IP address** uniquely identifies devices on a network, allowing them to locate and communicate with each other.
- **Types**: IPv4 and IPv6.

#### IPv4
- **Example:** 192.168.0.5 (32-bit address).
- Four decimal numbers separated by dots (0â€“255), with around 4.3 billion unique addresses.
- too much demand making IPv4 scarce and moving into IPv6

#### IPv6
- **Example:** 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334 (128-bit address).
- Eight groups of four hexadecimal digits separated by colons, providing enhanced security and more unique addresses.
- provides simple address assignment

### MAC Address (Media Access Control Address)
- A unique identifier for network interfaces, operating at the Data Link layer.
- **Example:** 00:1A:2B:3C:4D:5E (48-bit address).
- Facilitates device identification within a local network and is essential for security and communication.
- Operate on datalink layer (responsible for node to node transfer)

## Ports & Protocols: TCP, UDP

### What Are Ports?
- **Ports** are logical endpoints for communication, each assigned a specific number for different types of network communication.
- **Examples**: Port 80 for HTTP, Port 443 for HTTPS.

### What Are Protocols?
- **Protocols** are rules governing data transmission, ensuring data is formatted and transmitted correctly across a network.
- devices communication effectively by following the same set of rules. (e.g. devices must speak same language to understand eachother)
- **Examples**: HTTP, FTP, SMTP.

### TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)
- Ensures data sent from one device reaches another device accurately and in order.
- Set of rules devices follow to communicate with each other.

### Characteristics of TCP
- **Connection-Oriented**: Establishes a connection before data transmission.
- **hand shake**: the two devices agree to communicate.
- **Reliable**: Provides error checking and retransmits data if lost or corrupted. Ensures data sent gets received.

### Functions/Use Cases of TCP
- Suitable for bidirectional communication (when 2 devices need to exchange data back and forth) e.g. such as web browsing, emails, and file transfers.
- Ensure data is delivered in order.
- Error checking and flow control to prvent congestion.

### UDP (User Datagram Protocol)
- A faster, connectionless protocol suitable for real-time apps where speed is more critical than reliability.

### UDP Characteristics
- Simple protocol to send and receive data
- Priot comminication not required (has cons e.g. data can be sent immediately without establishing a connection, however there is no guarantee data reached desired location)
- connectionaless: no formal connection established between sender and receiver. Each packet is sent independently.
- Fast but less reliable. No guarantee packets are delivered in order.
- No error checking or flow control, what you send is what you get (errors included).

### Functions/Use Cases of UDP
- Used for real time application e.g. in online gaming, video streaming, and some VPN protocols.
- DNS (use udp behind the scenes)
- Some VPN use udp because it is faster and works better for streaming and real time applications

## Introduction to OSI Model

The **OSI Model** (Open Systems Interconnection) provides a standard framework for understanding how data is shared between devices in seven layers.

---

## The 7 Layers of the OSI Model

### Why We Need a Communication Model

- **Standard Framework**: Simplifies device and app communication over a network (all devices can understand each other)
- **Application Independence**: Applications operate independently of the underlying network.
- **Simplified Network Management**: Facilitates easier upgrades.
- **Decoupled Innovation**: Allows updates on each layer independently.

### OSI Layers

#### Layer 7: Application Layer
- Directly provides network services to applications (e.g., HTTP, FTP, DNS).
- end user layer

#### Layer 6: Presentation Layer
- Translates data into a readable format and handles encryption.
- syntax user layer
- e.g. ssl, ssh, imap, mpeg, jpeg

#### Layer 5: Session Layer
- Manages sessions between applications, establishing and terminating connections.
- sync and send to port
- API's, sockets, winsock

#### Layer 4: Transport Layer
- Ensures end-to-end communication and data integrity (e.g., TCP, UDP).

#### Layer 3: Network Layer
- Manages packet routing and forwarding of data (e.g.IP, ICMP, IPSec, IGMP).

#### Layer 2: Data Link Layer
- Ensures node-to-node data transfer and error detection (e.g., Ethernet, MAC addresses, PPP, Switch, Bridge).
- Frames

#### Layer 1: Physical Layer
- Transmits raw bit streams over a physical medium (e.g., cables, wireless signals).
- Physical structure

## Layer Details

### Layer 1: Physical Layer
**Function**:
- Transmit raw bit streams over physical media (e.g., cables, network interface cards).
- No device addressing (all data processed by all devices)

### Layer 2: Data Link Layer
**Function**:
- Ensures node-to-node data transfer and detects errors from the physical layer. Ensures data is transferred correctly between adjacent network nodes.
- Ensures data packets are correctly sent/received between different network nodes.
- puts data packets into frames (like an enevlope with an address ensuring it goes to the right place)
- compnents: mac addresses, switches and bridges

### Layer 3: Network Layer
**Function**:
- How the data is sent to the recepient. 
- Routes data packets to the recipient, managing paths through intermediate routers.
- Manages packet forwarding including routing through intermediate routers.
- Chooses best path for data to travel.
- Components: IP addresses (handles where packets go to), routers
- Data organised into packets (carries data to target)

### Layer 4: Transport Layer
**Function**:
- Provides reliable data transfer services to the upper layers, segmenting and reassembling data as needed.
- End-to-end connextions
- Components: TCP (provides reliable audit and error free data), UDP (less reliable and not guaranteed) 

### Layer 5: Session Layer
**Function**:
- Manages sessions between applications, establishing, maintaining (keeping session alive), and terminating connections.
- Synch and send to port
- API's, Sockets, Winsock
- Components: Session management protocols e.g. RPC, NetBIOS etc

### Layer 6: Presentation Layer
**Function**: 
- Translates data between application layer and network layer
- Ensures data is in a usable format and handles encryption.
- aka syntax layer
- Components: Encryption (ensure data security), data formatting 

### Layer 7: Application Layer
**Function**: 
- Directly provides network services to applications.
- End user layer
- Components: HTTP (for access websites and web services), FTP (for trasferring files between different servers), SMTP (for sending emails)

## TCP/IP Model
- A compressed format of OSI model with only 4 layers
- Common model
- Layers: Applciation, Transport, Internet, Network Access
- Application: network applciations and protocols operate (e.g. http, tls, dns)
- Transport: end-to-end communcation and data transfer between devices (e.g. TCP, UDP)
- Internet: reposible for logical addressing and routing data across different networks (IP - handles delivery of data packets from source to destination across multiple networks)
- Network access: compressed format of layer 1 and 2 of OSI model. Physical and data aspects e.g. ethernet, wireless


## Ports and Protocols
- ports are logical endpoints for communicatiion e.g. port 80 for http, port 443 for https
- ports allow communication between devices, ensures data goes to the right place
- protocols are rules governing data transmission (how it is formatted and transmitted) 

## TCP
- Ensures data reaches device accurately and in correct order, rules devices follow to communicate.
- Connection oriented: agree to communicate before data is exchanged
- requires a three way handshake where devices syncronises and acknowledge each other (agree to communicate).
- reliable data transfer, TCP will resend data if data is lost/corrupted
- use case: ensure data is delivered in order, error checking in data and control flow of data to prevent congestion. Used for any bidirectional communication (back and forth) e.g. web browsing, emails etc.

## UDP
- Connectionless: no former connection established between sender and receiver.
- Simple protocol to send and receive data
- No prior communication (data sent without establishing connection so no guaratee data reaches destination)
- Each packet is sent independently
- Fast but not reliable
- use cases: video streaming, online gaming, vidoes. DNS and VPNs (some vpn protocols). Real time applications

## DNS (Domain name system)
- DNS makes IP address human friendly, for us to keep track of websites.
- Translates domain names to IP addresses.
- Purpose: To simplify navigating the internet and access website/services.

## DNS components
### Name servers
- Cruicial for DNS functionality
- Loads DNS settings and configurations, and responds to your queries from clients or other servers about domain names.
- Two typers, authoritative name servers and recursive name servers
- Authoritative name servers: hold actual DNS records - provide the IP address for a domain name when queried.
- Recursive name servers: Do no hold final answers, they query other name servers on behalf of the client to find the correct DNS record. They can capture the information of the DNS for future queries to speed things up.

### Zone files
- Store information about the domain
- Help name servers answer queries about how to get to a domain if the name server is not available directly
- Organise your DNS info in a readable and managed way, making it easier to handle DNS records.

### Records
- Entries in a zone file with specific information
- Each record has specific info about hosts, name servers and various other resources
- Components: Record name, TTL, Class, Type, Data

#### DNS Records (Different type of records)
 - A = Maps a domain name to an IPv4 Address e.g. google.com -> 216.58.204.79
 - AAAA = Maps a domain name to an IPv6 Address e.g. google.com -> 2a00:1450:4009:81d::200e
 - CNAME (canonical name) = Alias of one name to another. It allows you to point multiple domain names to the same IP address. Simplifies DNS management e.g. www.google.com -> google.com
 - MX - Specifies the mail server responsible for receiving email for the domain. Includes priority value. e.g. google.com -> mailserver.google.com
 - TXT = Allows domain administrators to insert any text into DNS. Commonly used for verification purposed and to hold SPF (Sender Policy Framework) data. Uses: verification, SPF data, other metadata e.g. google.com -> "v=spf1 include.com ~all".


## How does DNS work?
1 - you type in a web address into your browser
2 - browser sends a request to a local DNS resolver
3 - DNS server does a query. Receives request and starts searching for the IP address.
4 - First it checks its local cache (previously accessed)
5 - Resolver queries a root server for the IP address (Root server does not yet know the IP of the domain).
6 - The root server knows where to find the .com TDL domain server. So the DNS resolver queries the TDL Server.
7 - The TDL server doesn't know the IP address but knows the authoritative server. So the DNS resolver queries the Authoritative Server 
8 - Then the resolver queries the authoritative server which has the IP address.
9 - IP address sent to the DNS resolver.
10 - DNS resolver sends IP address to your browser allowing it to connect to the wen server.

### DNS resoultion
- The process of converting domain names into IP addresses

### DNS hierarchy and Distribution
- DNS Root: Top of hierarchy. Has high level info of where to find the top level domains underneath it.
- Top level domains (TLD): Include familiar extensions e.g. .com .org .co.uk. For example the .com registry is managed by versign. Each TLD has info of domains within it's scope.
- Authoritative name servers: each server hosts, zones for domains - they have the detailed DNS records for those domains. For example google.com or x.com have their own DNS records stored here (in the .com LTD)
- Domain: each domain has a zone and zonefile. Zonefile is where all the specific information like IP addresses, mail servers of the domains are stored.

### Domain Registrar vs DNS Hosting provider

- DR: allows you to purchase and register domains. It communicated with the TDL registry to manage domain registrations. e.g. route53, godaddy, cloudflare etc
- DNS HP: Operates DNS nameservers that host DNS Zones. Manage DNS records within these zones.

When purchasing a domain, you need DNS Zone to be hosted on a DNS name server.
