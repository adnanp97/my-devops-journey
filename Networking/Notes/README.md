Introduction to computer networks
- group of devices connected to each other allowing them to share info and resources

Local area network (LAN)
- samll covers small are
- Example home wifi

Widde area network WAN
- internet is an example

### Importance in modern infrastructure

Foundation - enables communication between devices

Resource sharing - Facilitates sharing of files printers and more

Internet functionality - critical for browsing, streaming and communication

Application support - backbone for app connectivity and data transfer


### Netorking in DevOps

Server interation - enables communication between servers and applications

Deployment - critical for launching and updating applicaitons

Management - cruical in monitioning and managing infrastructure

Opimisation - enhances troublue shooting, performance and scalability (data moving smooth and fast between devices)

## Network basics and types of networks - LAN & WAN etc

### Types of Networks

LAN
- small area e.g. home or office
- connects devices to share resource
- connects devices in a single locaiton e.g. printers, computers, internet access in a small area

WAN
- best example is internet which connects devices globally
- Large area e.g. citym country, larger region

## Switches, routers and firewalls

### Switches
- think of it as a manager of your LAN
- Connect devices within the same network e.g. cpu, printers
- Manage data flow within a LAN
- switches ensures data flows smoothly between these devices


### Routers
- like a traffic warden for a network e.g. router connets home network to internet. ensures data gets to the correct location, whether you are browsing, streaming etc.
- main role is to direct traffic between networks
- connect different networks e.g. home network to internet


### Firewalls
- acts as a bodyguard for your network
- Protect networks from unauthorised access
- monitors and controls incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predetermined security rules

## IP address (Internet protocol address) & MAC address

### IP Addressing 
- An IP address - unique for devises on a network
- Allows devices to locate and communicate
- The two types are IPv4 and IPv6

### IP Addressing (IPv4 & IPv6)
#### IPv4
- 192.168.0.5
- 32-bit address
- Format: four decinmal numbers separated by dots
- each group ranges from 0 to 255 providing around 4.3 billion unique addresses (rapid growth means we need IPv6)

#### IPv6
- 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334
- 128-bit address
- Format: eight groups of four hexadecimal digits separate by colons
- More enhanced: security and simplified address assignment

It is essential to transition into IPv6 due to continual growth of the internet.
Without IP Addresses, devices would not know where to send or receive data

### MAC Address (media access controll address)
- Unique identifer assigned to network interfaces.
- Each device on a network has its own unique MAC address
- importance - essential for network communication and security
- 48-bit address e.g. 00:1A:2B:3C:4D:5E
- operates at the datalink layer (Data link layer is responsibile for node ot node transfer)
- faciliates device identification within a local network (devices can identify each other e.g. your laptop connects to right router and not neighbours)
- without MAC addresses - critical for security and communication; devices would not be able to communicate properly. Help manage and control access to a network, ensuring data pakcets gets sent to the right place.
