1. explain why Git is crucial for collaboration in software development and
DevOps, particularly in managing code changes and enabling teamwork across

2. Git Workflow
Using the previous BASH Scripting Tasks, which you should have completed,
do the Following:
a) Create a feature branch: Do your changes on a new Git branch, following
best practices for naming (e.g., feature/script-enhancements).
b) Creative Changes: Implement creative, significant improvements or new
features in your BASH scripts.
c) Make meaningful commits: Ensure that your commits are properly formatted
with descriptive messages.
d) Create a Merge Request (MR): Once your changes are complete, submit an
MR. I will be added as a reviewer to ensure proper Git practices are followed
and to review the creativity of your changes.


3. Engage on LinkedIn: Share your learning journey! Create 2-3 LinkedIn posts about
what youâ€™ve learned in the Git module and make sure to tag @CoderCo so we can
help amplify and support your posts.
