# Linux notes
### Linux Operating System and Kernels basics
---
**What is Linux?**
Linus is operating sysyem. An operating system is softwre which allows you to interact and send instruction to hardware via a kernel.

**User Interaction:** 
The user interacts with the operating system (OS). This interaction can be through a graphical user interface (GUI) with windows and icons or a command-line interface (CLI) with text commands.

**Role of the Kernel:** 
The operating system includes the kernel, which is the core part of the OS. The kernel handles critical tasks such as managing hardware resources (CPU, memory, storage) and executing system calls from applications.

**Kernel and Hardware:** 
When the user performs an action, such as opening a file or running an application, the OS translates these actions into requests that the kernel processes. The kernel then communicates with the hardware to complete these tasks.

**In Summary:**
User → Interacts with the OS.
OS → Includes the Kernel.
Kernel → Handles hardware interactions and executes tasks.
So, the kernel does the actual work of interacting with the hardware based on the user's commands processed by the operating system. 

My understanding:
A user interacts with an operating system (software e.g. Linux), this operation system has a kernel. When a person interacts with the operating system, the real work is done by the kernel which interacts with the actual hardware. 

**What is command line interface (CLI) for?**
The CLI allows you to interact with OS by typing commands. You can run scripts, exceute commands and manage system effeciently.

Your command is interpretted by the shell. **Your input is a command and the result is the standard output.**

**The purpose of a shell is** to serve as a command-line interface between the user and the operating system. It allows you to interact with the system by typing commands, which the shell interprets and executes.

**Note: Without an operating system or kernel, you will not be able to interact with the hardware**
- No operating system means there will be not interface to interact with the computer.
- No kernel means tasks will not get excetued as the kernel is what tells the hardware (like the CPU, memory, and storage) how to work together. Without it, your computer wouldn’t know how to use its parts.
